            <p>I got into the software biz in 1991 back before the internet, before the introduction of Microsoft Windows and the mouse.</p>
                
            <p>I worked as a Software Configuration Manager and Unix/QNX admin for Beckman Instruments and went to school at night working towards a degree in Computer Science. I 
                eventually graduated from California State University of Fullerton, CA with my BS in CS and immediatlely went to work for TRW as a developer integrating satelite 
                telemetry feeds into a health and monitoring system. In 1996 I became a member of the development team at Schriever AFB working on the user interface of the 
                war gaming test bed which emulated the systems used in the Cheyene Mountain facility.</p>
                
            <p>In 1997 I hired on with MCI in Colorado Springs and worked in the telecommunications field. My team created a voice recognition platform which 
                used the Nuance speech engine. We created custom speech applications using Java Servlets, VoiceXML/GRXML/CSS, and javascript.</p>    
                
            <p>MCI eventually became part of Verizon and after almost 18 years I was involved in a RIFF. Two months later RELX Group hired me as their Interactive Voice 
                Response (IVR) expert where I assumed responsibility for all of their self service IVR applications and integrations working with Java on the
                Avaya platform. We eventually migrated the applications from the in-house Avaya platform to the inContact cloud based platform.
                RELX Group then made the decision to move most of the inContact platform support to the Philippines and, after 4 years with the company, 
                I was again involed in a RIFF.</p>    
                
            <p>I then made the decision to enroll in a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp with the goal of eventually getting onto a web development team.</p>
