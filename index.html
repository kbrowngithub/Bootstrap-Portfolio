                    <p>I got into the software biz in 1991 back before the internet, before the introduction of Microsoft Windows and
                        the mouse.</p>
                
                    <p>I worked as a Software Configuration Manager and Unix/QNX admin for Beckman Instruments and went to school at
                        night working towards a degree in Computer Science. I
                        eventually graduated from California State University of Fullerton, CA with my BS in CS and immediatlely went to
                        work for TRW as a developer integrating satelite
                        telemetry feeds into a health and monitoring system. In 1996 I became a member of the development team at
                        Schriever AFB working on the user interface of the
                        war gaming test bed which emulated the systems used in the Cheyene Mountain facility.</p>
                
                    <p>In 1997 I hired on with MCI in Colorado Springs and worked in the telecommunications field. My team created a
                        voice recognition platform which
                        used the Nuance speech engine. We created custom speech applications using Java Servlets, VoiceXML/GRXML/CSS,
                        and javascript.</p>
                
                    <p>MCI eventually became part of Verizon and after almost 18 years I was involved in a RIFF. Two months later RELX
                        Group hired me as their Interactive Voice
                        Response (IVR) expert where I assumed responsibility for all of their self service IVR applications and
                        integrations working with Java on the
                        Avaya platform. We eventually migrated the applications from the in-house Avaya platform to the inContact cloud
                        based platform.
                        RELX Group then made the decision to move most of the inContact platform support to the Philippines and, after 4
                        years with the company,
                        I was again involed in a RIFF.</p>
                
                    <p>I then made the decision to enroll in a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp with the goal of eventually getting
                        onto a web development team.</p>
