                            <p>I began my career in the software biz back in 1991.</p>
                        
                            <p>I worked as a Software Configuration Manager and Unix/QNX admin for Beckman Instruments and went to school at
                                night working towards a degree in Computer Science. I
                                eventually graduated from California State University of Fullerton, CA with my BS in CS and immediatlely went to
                                work for TRW as a developer integrating satelite
                                telemetry feeds into a health and monitoring system. In 1996 I became a member of the development team at
                                Schriever AFB working on the user interface of the
                                war gaming test bed which emulated the systems used in the Cheyene Mountain facility.</p>
                        
                            <p>In 1997 I hired on with MCI in Colorado Springs and worked in the telecommunications field. My team created a
                                voice recognition platform which
                                used the Nuance speech engine. We created custom speech applications using Java Servlets, VoiceXML/GRXML/CSS,
                                and javascript.</p>
                        
                            <p>MCI eventually became part of Verizon and after almost 18 years I was involved in a RIFF. Two months later RELX
                                Group hired me as their Interactive Voice
                                Response (IVR) expert where I assumed responsibility for all of their self service IVR applications and
                                integrations working with Java on the
                                Avaya platform. We eventually migrated the applications from the in-house Avaya platform to the inContact cloud
                                based platform.
                                RELX Group then made the decision to move most of the inContact platform support to the Philippines and, after 4
                                years with the company,
                                I was again involed in a RIFF.</p>
                        
                            <p>I then made the decision to enroll in a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp with the goal of eventually getting
                                onto a web development team.</p>
